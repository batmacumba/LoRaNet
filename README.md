## About The Project

This software can be used to create mesh networks between LoRa devices. It should be considered a prototype implementation for research purposes **only**. The messages transmitted on this network are sent in plain-text, and there is no guarantee of confidentiality, or of authentication of received messages.


## Compatibility

At the moment this project is only compatible with the _Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2)_ board.

## Getting Started

Upload the [example sketch](examples/sender/sender.ino) provided to your board using the Arduino IDE.
